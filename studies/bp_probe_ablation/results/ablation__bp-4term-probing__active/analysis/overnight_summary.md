# Overnight Experiment Summary

**Last updated**: 2026-04-13 07:50
**Status**: Wave 3 IN PROGRESS (P11 running, P12-P14 queued), Wave 4 PREPARED (P15-P18)

---

## Executive Summary

Wave 1 probes (6 experiments, 56 runs) + Wave 2 partial results reveal:

1. **Temperature controls iteration speed, not just diversity**: P07 agent_1 (temp=1.2) completed 15 runs vs agent_0 (temp=0.3) with only 3 runs in the same 30-min budget
2. **NEW RECORD: bpb=0.906257** achieved by P07 agent_1 (temp=1.2) — below all previous results
3. **Shared memory was BROKEN** in P06/P07: format mismatch in trace.jsonl (agents skip `update_snapshot.py`) — **NOW FIXED** via results.tsv-based population
4. **Private memory was ALSO BROKEN**: `_build_memory_context()` read from trace.jsonl (empty) — **NOW FIXED** to use results.tsv
5. **30s training is useless** (P04) — model can't converge
6. **"Optimization" is the winning strategy category** — appears in most improvement runs
7. **Smaller models converge better in 60s**: P08 first run (357K params) got bpb=0.982 vs default (897K) getting 1.167

## Critical Bug Fixes (This Session)

### 1. Shared Memory Format Mismatch (FIXED)

**Root cause**: `_append_shared_log()` in monitoring loop read trace.jsonl expecting `accepted` field and non-null `val_bpb_after`. But agents call `save_snapshot.py` (writes `val_bpb_after: None, confirmed: None`) then SKIP `update_snapshot.py`. The filter `if accepted is None and val_bpb is None: continue` always triggered → shared memory stayed empty.

**Fix**: Changed monitoring loop to populate shared memory from `results/results.tsv` entries (agents reliably write here) instead of trace.jsonl. File: `claude_agent_runner.py` lines 497-530.

**Impact**: P06 and P07 ran WITHOUT actual memory sharing. Their results should be interpreted as "parallel diverse" not "parallel shared."

### 2. Private Memory Context Empty (FIXED)

**Root cause**: `_build_memory_context()` also read from trace.jsonl. Same problem — `val_bpb_after: None` entries get skipped at `if bpb is None: continue`.

**Fix**: Rewrote to use `results/results.tsv` as primary data source. Also updated `_count_private_memory_entries()` to count from results.tsv.

**Impact**: P05 and P08 ran with EMPTY memory context despite being configured for memory. These are equivalent to "single agent without memory."

## Design Audit (Complete)

Deep statistical analysis of the 2x2 experiment identified **5 confounds**:

| # | Confound | Evidence | Severity |
|---|----------|----------|----------|
| 1 | **CPU contention** in d11 | Kruskal-Wallis H=56.3, p<0.001 | CRITICAL |
| 2 | **Agent homogeneity** (G=0) | Jaccard 0.75-1.00 in d01 | CRITICAL |
| 3 | **Memory anchoring** (e<0) | Streak length d10=4.2 vs d00=2.4 | MODERATE |
| 4 | **Task ceiling** (12% success rate) | Regularization 0/50 wins | STRONG |
| 5 | **Budget insufficiency** (run-9 wall) | d11 avg 7.5 runs < threshold 9 | STRONG |

**Deliverables**: PDF report (13 pages), 6 figures, 3 analysis docs, JSON stats

## Rapid Probing

### Critical Fix: Training Time Enforcement

The baseline `train.py` used fixed `MAX_STEPS=585` which took ~315s on this CPU. Changed to time-based stopping via `AUTOSEARCH_TIME_BUDGET` env var. P01 used old template (315s/run), P02-P06 used fixed baseline script (60s/run).

### Wave 1 Results (COMPLETE)

| Probe | Type | Runs | Improv Rate | Best Rel Improv | Temporal Align | Switch Rate |
|-------|------|------|------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **P06** | shared+diverse* | 10 | **50%** (4/8) | 4.15% | 1.0 (converged) | 0.63 |
| P05 | single+memory* | 7 | 33% (2/6) | 2.58% | N/A | 0.67 |
| P03 | single | 8 | 29% (2/7) | 4.96% | N/A | 0.14 |
| P02 | parallel diverse | 14 | 25% (3/12) | 7.08% | 0.17 (diverse) | 0.50 |
| P01 | parallel homo** | 7 | 20% (1/5) | 0.36% | 0.0 | 0.60 |
| P04 | single 30s | 10 | **0%** (0/9) | 0% | N/A | 0.56 |

*Memory mechanisms were broken — P05/P06 effectively ran without memory
**P01 used old template (315s/run), not directly comparable

### Wave 2 Results (IN PROGRESS)

#### P07: Parallel Shared + Diverse, 30 min — COMPLETE

| Agent | Temp | Runs | Best bpb | Strategy |
|-------|------|------|----------|----------|
| agent_0 | 0.3 | 3 | 0.925845 | Conservative — 85% turns were pure thinking |
| agent_1 | 1.2 | 15 | **0.906257** | Fast iteration — every turn productive |

**KEY FINDING: Temperature = iteration speed.** temp=1.2 agent completed 5x more runs than temp=0.3 agent. High-temp agent doesn't "think harder" — it acts faster, explores more, and finds better results through volume. Shared memory was broken (0 bytes), so this was effectively "parallel diverse."

#### P08: Single + Memory, 30 min — COMPLETE

| Run | bpb | Category | Trend |
|-----|-----|----------|-------|
| 1 | 0.982 | other | baseline |
| 2-14 | 1.167→1.548 | mixed | monotonic degradation |

**14 runs, 0 improvements.** Agent increased model size each turn, making convergence impossible in 60s. Memory was broken (no context injected). Clear negative result: without functional memory, single agent degrades monotonically and cannot self-correct.

#### P09: Parallel Diverse, 30 min — COMPLETE

| Agent | Temp | Runs | Best bpb | Below Baseline |
|-------|------|------|----------|----------------|
| agent_0 | 0.3 | 14 | 1.013 | 0 |
| agent_1 | 1.2 | 15 | 0.971 | 0 |

**29 total runs, 0 improvements.** Unlike P07, both agents had similar run counts (14 vs 15) — temperature effect on speed wasn't dramatic here. Neither agent found the learning rate optimization trick. High diversity (Jaccard=0.800) but no productive outcomes.

#### P10: Parallel Homo, 15 min — COMPLETE

| Agent | Runs | Best bpb | Below Baseline |
|-------|------|----------|----------------|
| agent_0 | 7 | 0.960 | 0 |
| agent_1 | 7 | 0.960 | 0 |

**14 total runs, 0 improvements.** Fair comparison to P01 with fixed 60s template. Both agents started from same baseline (0.960) and neither improved. Jaccard=1.0 confirms agent homogeneity.

### Wave 3 Results (IN PROGRESS — P11 running, P12-P14 queued)

#### P11: Single, temp=1.2, 45 min — IN PROGRESS

| Run | bpb | Category | Trend |
|-----|-----|----------|-------|
| 1 | 0.933 | baseline | — |
| 2-7 | 1.626→2.305 | optimization | monotonic degradation |
| 8 | 1.228 | other | partial correction via git revert |
| 9-12 | 1.552→2.180 | optimization | re-degradation |

**KEY FINDING: G without ε = random walk.** The high-temp agent (same as P07 agent_1 which set the record) makes increasingly aggressive LR changes (5e-3 → 8e-3 → 1.5e-2 → 2.5e-2) without learning that these are harmful. Brief self-correction via git revert (run 8) is not sustained — agent immediately re-degrades. Mean Δ per run = +0.113 bpb (getting worse). 0/11 non-baseline runs below baseline.

**Implication**: P07's 0.906 was LUCKY — the agent happened to try LR=1.5e-3 at run 14. With a longer budget, the same strategy consistently fails. This proves G (information generation) alone is necessary but NOT sufficient; you need ε (routing/correction via memory) to sustain progress.

#### P12-P14: Queued (start after P11 finishes ~08:13)

| Probe | Design | Budget | Tests |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| **P12** | Shared + diverse, temp=0.5/1.2 | 45 min | FIRST REAL shared memory test (both mechanisms now fixed) |
| **P13** | Parallel diverse, temp=1.0/1.2 | 45 min | Dual high-temp without memory |
| **P14** | Single + memory, temp=1.2 | 30 min | G + ε: does memory prevent P11-style degradation? |

### Wave 4 Design (READY — launches after Wave 3)

Based on Wave 1-3 findings:

| Probe | Design | Budget | Tests |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| **P15** | Single, temp=1.2 + LR hint | 45 min | Seeded search: explicit guidance reduces wasted exploration? |
| **P16** | Single, temp=0.5, LR=1.5e-3 | 45 min | Optimal baseline: what happens when starting near-optimal? |
| **P17** | Parallel shared+private+diverse | 45 min | Full BP framework: G + ε (both memory mechanisms) |
| **P18** | Parallel diverse + LR hint | 45 min | Seeded parallel: guidance + parallelism synergy? |

**Estimated Wave 3 duration**: ~165 min (P11=45 + P12=45 + P13=45 + P14=30)
**Estimated Wave 4 duration**: ~180 min (P15=45 + P16=45 + P17=45 + P18=45)

## Key Findings So Far

### 1. Temperature = Iteration Speed (Confirmed)
- temp=1.2: 15 runs / 30 min (every turn produces a training run)
- temp=0.3: 3 runs / 30 min (85% of turns spent "thinking")
- **This is the most important finding for the BP framework**: G (information generation) is directly controlled by temperature

### 2. G without ε = Random Walk (NEW — P11)
- P11 (temp=1.2, no memory, 45 min): 12 runs, 0 below baseline, mean degradation +0.113/run
- Agent oscillates: degrade → partial git-revert correction → re-degrade
- P07's record (0.906) was lucky — same strategy over longer horizon consistently fails
- **Critical for BP**: G alone generates noise; ε (memory/routing) converts noise into signal
- This is the STRONGEST evidence for the four-term decomposition

### 3. Shared Memory + Private Memory Were Non-Functional (FIXED x2)
- First fix: results.tsv-based population (agents skip update_snapshot.py)
- Second fix: training_runs.jsonl-based memory context (agents unreliably write results.tsv)
- Also fixed: `elif` → `if` to allow both shared and private memory simultaneously
- P12 (Wave 3) is the first real shared memory test
- P14 (Wave 3) is the first real private memory test
- P17 (Wave 4) is the first test with BOTH mechanisms active

### 3. 60s Training Sweet Spot
- 30s: No signal (P04 — 0% improvement)
- 60s: Good signal, ~1 min/run, allows 15+ runs in 30 min
- 315s: Fewer runs but each is more informative (P01)
- With 60s, SMALLER models (357K params) outperform larger ones (897K-1.6M)

### 4. Only Learning Rate Increases Work

Cross-probe analysis of 70 non-baseline runs across P01-P08:

| Category | Runs | Below Baseline | Success Rate |
|----------|------|---------------|--------------|
| optimization | 30 | 3 | 10.0% |
| regularization | 20 | 0 | 0.0% |
| other | 19 | 0 | 0.0% |

ALL 3 successful runs were **learning rate increases**:
- P01 run 3: LR 1e-3 → 2e-3 (bpb=0.9225)
- P05 run 3: LR to 2e-3 re-eval (bpb=0.9191)
- P07 run 14: LR to 1.5e-3 (bpb=0.9063)

**Implication**: With 60s training, the default LR (1e-3) is too conservative. Higher LR allows faster convergence. Regularization and architecture changes need more training time to show effects.
