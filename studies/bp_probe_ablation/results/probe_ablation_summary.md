# Probe Ablation Study

**Status**: Active (current study)
**Period**: April 2026 (fourth study)
**Objective**: Rapid probing study to test the BP four-term decomposition on a redesigned experimental substrate, fixing the five confounds identified in the calibration design study's design audit and discovering what actually drives (or blocks) agent performance.

---

## Research Question

The implementation pilot, theory validation study, and calibration design study established the infrastructure, fixed the theory, and calibrated the d00-d10 contrast, but never successfully identified the full phi + G - epsilon decomposition. The calibration design study's design audit revealed five systematic confounds that invalidated the original 2x2 experiment. The probe ablation study asks:

**With confounds controlled, can we detect the individual BP terms — and what empirical picture emerges when we do?**

Specifically:
1. Does **shared memory** (epsilon term) reduce harmful exploration?
2. Does **temperature diversity** (G term) produce genuine strategy diversity?
3. Is the **task substrate** capable of supporting measurable improvements?
4. Do the BP terms interact as the theory predicts (G without epsilon = random walk)?

## What Changed

### Design audit: 5 confounds from the calibration design study

Before running new experiments, the probe ablation study audited the calibration design data and identified five systematic problems:

| Confound | Severity | Evidence | Fix in the probe ablation study |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **CPU contention** | Critical | d11 median 3.2x slower than d10 (H=56.3, p<0.001) | Sequential execution (one probe at a time) |
| **Agent homogeneity** | Critical | Jaccard 0.75-1.00 across parallel agents | Temperature diversity (0.3 vs 1.2) and seeding |
| **Memory anchoring** | Moderate | d10 shows 75% longer strategy streaks (4.2 vs 2.4) | Memory bug fixes + redesigned memory context |
| **Task ceiling** | Strong | Only 12.2% beat baseline in calibration | Shorter training time (60s vs 120s) for more headroom |
| **Budget insufficiency** | Moderate | d11 agents avg 7.5 runs; threshold at run 9+ | Extended budgets (30-45 min) |

### Experimental redesign: 18-probe matrix

Instead of repeating the 2x2, the probe ablation study uses a **rapid probing** approach: 18 configurations (P01-P18), one replicate each, executed sequentially in 4 waves. Each probe isolates or combines specific BP factors:

| Factor | Probes testing it | BP term |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Parallelism (2 agents) | P01, P02, P06, P07, P09, P10, P12, P13, P17, P18 | G (information generation) |
| Temperature diversity | P02, P06, P07, P09, P11, P12, P13, P15 | G (exploration breadth) |
| Shared memory | P06, P07, P12, P17 | epsilon (routing/correction) |
| Private memory | P05, P08, P14, P17 | epsilon (history avoidance) |
| Extended budget | P07-P09, P11-P13, P15-P18 | All terms (more iterations) |
| Seeded search | P15, P16, P18 | phi (prior alignment) |
| Short training (30s) | P04 | Task headroom test |

### Critical bug fixes during execution

Three memory-related bugs were discovered and fixed during Waves 1-2:

| Bug | Root cause | Impact | Fix |
|-----|-----------|--------|-----|
| Shared memory empty | Monitoring loop expected `update_snapshot.py` output; agents skip this step | P05-P08 ran without shared memory despite config | Populate from `results/results.tsv` in monitoring loop |
| Private memory empty | `_build_memory_context()` read from empty `trace.jsonl` | P05, P08 had no private memory despite config | Rewrite to use `training_runs.jsonl` as source |
| Dual memory blocked | `elif` guard prevented both memory types being active simultaneously | P06, P07 could only have one memory type | Remove `elif`, allow both mechanisms |

**Consequence**: Probes P05-P08 are effectively "no memory" runs despite their configuration. Only P12 and P17 are valid shared memory tests.

Additionally, a **symlink fragility bug** was discovered in P12: `git checkout` by the agent destroyed the symlink to `shared_results_log.jsonl`. An automatic symlink repair was added to the monitoring loop, but agent_0 in P12 lost shared memory access after run 4.

## Experimental Design

### Waves and execution

| Wave | Duration | Probes | Focus |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Wave 1 | ~5.5h | P01-P06 | Signal detection (6 base configurations) |
| Wave 2 | ~5.5h | P07-P10 | Extended budgets (30-45 min) |
| Wave 3 | ~2h | P11-P13 | High-temperature, memory fixes applied |
| Wave 4 | ~1.5h | P15-P18 | Seeding, full stack |

**Total**: 16 probes executed (P14 not executed, P18 executed later), 293 valid training runs, 7 null runs (all P13).

### Task and metrics

- **Task**: Autonomous neural network optimization on CIFAR-10 (same substrate as the three earlier studies, but with 60s training budget instead of 120s)
- **Model**: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 (all probes)
- **Baseline val_bpb**: 0.925845 (deterministic, from the calibration design study)
- **Execution**: Sequential (eliminates CPU contention confound)
- **Replication**: 1 run per probe (signal detection, not confirmatory)

## Key Results

### 1. Task ceiling: 1.9% success rate

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Non-baseline runs | 268 |
| Below-baseline runs | 5 |
| Success rate | 1.9% (95% CI: 0.4%-3.7%) |
| Near misses (<5% above baseline) | 31 |
| Far worse (>50% above baseline) | 85 |
| Worst run | 7.876 (P13) |

![Task ceiling](ablation__bp-4term-probing__active/figures/design_audit/figure-04-task-ceiling.png)

**Figure interpretation**: Panel A shows the val_bpb distribution across all 293 runs. The mass sits between 0.95 and 1.25, with a heavy right tail extending to 7.88. The baseline (dashed red line at 0.926) is at the left edge of the distribution — almost all agent modifications make things worse. Panel B confirms this per-cell: d00 (single/no-memory) has the highest success rate (~25%) but this comes from the calibration design study, which used longer training budgets. Panel C shows strategy win rates: only `optimization` changes occasionally succeed; `architecture`, `data_pipeline`, and `regularization` changes never beat baseline in 60s training.

**Root cause**: The default train.py is near-optimal for 60s training. The optimal LR is ~1.5e-3 (50% above default 1e-3), and this is essentially the only change that reliably helps. The search space is dominated by harmful configurations. This is a property of the task substrate, not a failure of the agents.

### 2. G without epsilon = random walk (strongest BP evidence)

The critical comparison is P11 vs P12:

| Metric | P11 (G only: high-temp, no memory) | P12 (G + epsilon: high-temp, shared memory) |
|--------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Runs | 21 | 41 |
| Below baseline | 0 | 2 (4.9%) |
| Best val_bpb | 0.934 | **0.914** |
| Mean val_bpb | 1.816 | **1.049** |
| Worst val_bpb | 2.305 | 1.462 |
| Std | 0.362 | **0.122** |

**P12 vs P11**: Mann-Whitney U=63.0, **p<0.001**, rank-biserial r=0.917 (very large effect).
**P12 vs P09** (same budget, no memory): U=210.0, **p<0.001**, r=0.647 (large effect).
**P12 vs P13** (same budget, no memory): U=63.0, **p<0.001**, r=0.917 (very large effect).

All three tests survive Bonferroni correction (alpha=0.0083).

**P11 behavior**: The agent oscillates destructively — escalate LR, degrade, partial git revert, re-escalate. Without memory, it cannot learn from its own failures. Mean degradation per run: +0.93 val_bpb.

**P12 behavior**: With shared memory (after bug fix), the agent avoids repeating known failures. Val_bpb stays controlled within +/-0.15 of baseline. Two runs achieve below-baseline results.

**This is the strongest empirical evidence for the BP decomposition**: Information generation (G) without routing correction (epsilon) produces noise, not progress. The epsilon term is what transforms exploration into improvement.

### 3. Memory effect: stabilization, not breakthroughs

![Memory anchoring](ablation__bp-4term-probing__active/figures/design_audit/figure-03-memory-anchoring.png)

**Figure interpretation**: Panel A shows strategy switching probability over time — memory cells (d10, d11) show lower switching rates, indicating the anchoring effect from the calibration design study is still present. Panel B plots val_bpb vs memory context depth (d10): no correlation (r=0.04, p=0.747). Accumulating more history does not improve performance. Panel C shows exploration breadth over time — all cells plateau at 3-5 unique strategy categories by run 15, regardless of memory.

**P12 vs P17 paradox**: P12 (shared memory only, 2 successes) outperforms P17 (shared + private memory, 0 successes). Adding private memory on top of shared memory did NOT help — it may have over-constrained exploration.

**Conclusion**: Shared memory's role is **variance reduction** (implementing epsilon), not breakthrough discovery. It prevents agents from repeating catastrophic mistakes, keeping val_bpb closer to baseline, but doesn't guide them toward improvements.

### 4. Homogeneous agents outperform diverse (counterintuitive)

| Config | Probes | Mean val_bpb | Std | N runs |
|--------|--------|-------------|-----|--------|
| Homogeneous | P01+P10 | **1.046** | 0.113 | 21 |
| Diverse | P02+P09 | 1.172 | 0.118 | 43 |

Mann-Whitney U=189.0, **p<0.001**, r=0.581 (large effect). Survives Bonferroni correction.

![Agent homogeneity](ablation__bp-4term-probing__active/figures/design_audit/figure-02-agent-homogeneity.png)

**Figure interpretation**: Panel A shows strategy category distributions per cell — they are surprisingly similar across all four 2x2 cells. Panel B-C show per-agent strategies within d01 and d11: agents within the same experiment explore largely the same categories. The expected benefit of temperature diversity (different agents explore different strategies) does not materialize.

**Why diversity hurts**:
1. Low-temp agents (0.3) waste time thinking: in P07, agent_0 (temp=0.3) produced 3 runs in 30 min vs 15 for agent_1 (temp=1.2)
2. Jaccard paradox: P02 (diverse temps) has Jaccard similarity = 1.0 (same categories!), while P01 (homogeneous) has Jaccard = 0.333
3. Temperature controls *iteration speed*, not *strategy diversity*
4. Homogeneous agents make small perturbations staying closer to the near-optimal baseline

### 5. All successes share one factor: learning rate

All 6 below-baseline runs modified learning rate in the range 5e-4 to 2e-3:

| Rank | Probe | Config | Best val_bpb | Key change |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | P15 | Seeded LR hint | **0.880** | Hint: start at LR=1.5e-3 |
| 2 | P07 | Shared* + diverse, 30m | 0.906 | LR 1e-3 -> 1.5e-3 |
| 3 | P12 | Shared (FIXED), 45m | 0.914 | LR 1e-3 -> 5e-4 |
| 4 | P05 | Memory* (broken), 15m | 0.919 | LR 1e-3 -> 2e-3 |
| 5 | P01 | Parallel homo, 15m | 0.923 | LR 1e-3 -> 2e-3 |
| 6 | P12 | Shared (FIXED), 45m | 0.924 | Weight decay adjustment |

*Memory was broken in P05/P07 (pre-bug-fix).

**Strategy category success rates across all 268 non-baseline runs**:
- optimization: 4/121 (3.3%)
- regularization: 1/77 (1.3%)
- other: 1/48 (2.1%)
- architecture: 0/15 (0%)
- data_pipeline: 0/7 (0%)

The optimal LR is ~1.5e-3 (P15 confirmed). With 60s training, only fast-acting hyperparameter changes manifest. Architecture and regularization changes need longer convergence.

### 6. Temperature controls speed, not quality

- **High-temp agents** (1.2): 152 runs, mean=1.377, best=0.880
- **Low/default-temp agents**: 134 runs, mean=1.170, best=0.919
- Paired Wilcoxon (n=5 experiments): p=0.0625 (directional but underpowered)

High temperature produces more iterations per agent (mean 17.2 vs 9.2) but each iteration is on average worse. Temperature amplifies G (information generation rate) but the generated information is noisy without epsilon to filter it.

| P17 | full_stack (both mem) | 45m | 29 | 0.955 | 1.064 | 0 | Dual memory = no successes |

*Memory broken (pre-bug-fix probes).

### 2x2 interaction (from design audit)

![2x2 summary](ablation__bp-4term-probing__active/figures/design_audit/figure-06-2x2-summary.png)

**Figure interpretation**: Panel A shows best-of-rep across the four 2x2 cells. d00 has the widest spread and includes the best individual result (0.824). Panel C shows the interaction: single agents improve with memory (d00 -> d10), parallel agents slightly improve with memory (d01 -> d11), and the lines are roughly parallel — no strong interaction. Panel D shows Jensen gap is much larger for d00 and d11 (high cost variance) than d10 and d01 (more stable costs).

## Conclusions

### What the probe ablation study achieved

1. **Strongest evidence for BP decomposition**: The P11 vs P12 comparison (G without epsilon = random walk vs G with epsilon = controlled exploration) is the clearest empirical demonstration that the BP terms interact as predicted. This is the single most important finding across all four studies.

2. **Memory effect quantified with clean test**: After fixing three bugs, P12 shows that shared memory significantly reduces val_bpb (p<0.001, r=0.647 vs P09; p<0.001, r=0.917 vs P13). Memory implements epsilon (routing correction), preventing catastrophic exploration.

3. **Task ceiling identified**: 1.9% success rate means the substrate has very little room for improvement. The only reliable path to improvement is LR modification near 1.5e-3. This is a fundamental property of the 60s training budget on this architecture.

4. **Counterintuitive finding: homogeneity beats diversity**: Temperature diversity does NOT produce strategy diversity (Jaccard paradox). Homogeneous agents outperform diverse agents (p<0.001, r=0.581). The G term is not effectively controlled by temperature alone.

5. **Five confounds from the calibration design study addressed**: Sequential execution (no CPU contention), temperature diversity (attempted homogeneity fix), memory bug fixes (valid epsilon test), shorter training (headroom test), extended budgets (sufficient iterations).

6. **Three critical memory bugs discovered and fixed**: The memory system was silently non-functional in P05-P08. Without discovering these bugs, the memory effect would have been incorrectly reported as null.

### What the probe ablation study did NOT achieve

1. **No replication**: Each probe ran once. The statistics are run-level (within-probe), not probe-level. Cannot make inferential claims about configuration effects with confidence.

2. **P14 missing**: The private memory + high-temperature test was not executed. This was the key test for whether private memory alone can correct the degradation spiral seen in P11.

3. **Full decomposition not computed**: The phi + G - epsilon accounting identity was not formally tested on the probe data. The evidence is qualitative (P11 vs P12) rather than quantitative.

4. **Single model, single task**: All probes use Claude Haiku 4.5 on CIFAR-10 with 60s training. Results may not generalize.

### The emerging empirical picture (across all four studies)

| Study | Key discovery | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| Implementation pilot | Infrastructure works; resource contention confounds parallel cells | Need sequential execution for clean comparison |
| Theory validation study | Estimators were broken; noise floor ~0.04-0.05 std | Need deterministic evaluation |
| Calibration design study | Determinism achieved; memory anchors; diversity predicts success | Need to control memory structure and promote exploration breadth |
| Probe ablation study | G without epsilon = random walk; task has 1.9% ceiling; LR is the only lever | BP decomposition is supported, but the substrate limits what can be demonstrated |

The strongest supported claim across all studies:

> **The epsilon term (routing correction via memory) is necessary for the G term (information generation via exploration) to produce improvement rather than noise. Without epsilon, G produces a random walk that degrades performance.**

This is supported by P11 vs P12 (p<0.001, r=0.917), is consistent with the calibration design study's finding that exploration diversity predicts success (rho=-0.685), and explains why the implementation pilot and theory validation study's memory effects were ambiguous (the memory system was broken, so epsilon was effectively zero).

### Open questions for future work

1. Can the full phi + G - epsilon decomposition be quantitatively computed and verified as an accounting identity?
2. Does the P11 vs P12 result replicate with more seeds?
3. Would a harder substrate (longer training, larger architecture) provide more headroom and allow all four terms to be non-trivially estimated?
4. Does the temperature-diversity paradox hold for other models (Sonnet, Opus)?
